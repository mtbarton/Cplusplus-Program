# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

-The project is data storage program that is solving the problem of maintaining animal tracking data for the client.

What did you do particularly well?

-My integration of a global vector for storing and deleting data worked well in almost every method call. The switch statement and user menu all functioned as intended.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

-The Java class within the program worked as intended, but the integration into the other function calls and the global vector needs some tweaking.
-When using the generate data menu function, then adding a record, the newly added record would overwrite the first entery in the .txt file.
-This results in rather redundant functions, and fixing this issue would result in more effecient software.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

-Figuring out how to incorporate a global vector and integrating it into the function calls was the most challenging. Through some helpful hints from StackOverflow and a C++
-forum I was able to figure out how to initialize the vector and manipulate it in the function calls.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

-The use of Java classes and libraries will surely prove useful in future projects, as this adds more functionality and flexibility to C++. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

-I attempted to make each function as simple as possible. Adding in-line comments points the reader to each functions intended use, increasing readability and adaptability.
